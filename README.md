GitHub hello-world guide

My name is Nghia Nguyen, I'm from Arlington Texas and I'm learning to program.
I've learned from various sources, such as FreeCodeCamp.org, eDx.org, MOOC.fi and LaunchSchool.com
I've been focusing on Java lately, but have also dabbled in Ruby, HTML & CSS.
My hobbies include gaming, reading, watching TV shows and playing tennis.
